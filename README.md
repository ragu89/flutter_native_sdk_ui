# flutter_native_sdk_ui

Try to use a 3rd party native library with interactions with the UI.

This project is using the native UI library [PhotoEditorSDK](https://photoeditorsdk.com/) from [https://github.com/imgly](img.ly).

We try to :
- Open a UI component working with the camera
- Open a UI component loading an image to apply filters on it

This project is inspired by : https://medium.com/coding-with-flutter/intro-to-platform-channels-building-an-image-picker-in-flutter-7e79c20065
